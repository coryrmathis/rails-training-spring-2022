# Let's Learn Rails!

This is Rails Foundations Training. We'll be working together over the next 5 days to learn more about Ruby and the Rails framework. By the end of this training, you should have a foundational grasp of how Rails works and be able to apply your newfound knowledge to your work. Obviously, there's only so much that we will be able to cover in 5 days, so we'll also focus on learning how to learn - we'll make use of the Rails' documentation and resources as well as each other so that you leave this course equipped with the tools needed to continue learning.

1. We'll strive to make this as interactive as possible. Nobody wants to watch a screencast for 20 hours (and we'd run out of breath talking at you for that long), so we'll be remote pairing using Zoom's breakout rooms feature. We'll also be asking for your input throughout the class - we can use Zoom's hand raising feature for that.

1. We'll work in plenty of breaks - I know I can't sit still all day long and I imagine everyone here is in a similar boat. When we go on break, please stay connected to zoom to keep breakout rooms intact. You may mute yourself and turn off your video during this time.

1. To the extent that you're able to keep your camera and mic on, we ask that you please do. Of course, we're all adults and emergencies happen especially if there are other people home with you, but by being able to see your faces, it's easier on us as instructors to see if you're confused or have questions. If things do get unexpectedly noisy, please mute as it makes sense.

1. During the course, we will be breaking up into pairs to go through hands-on activities. If this is something that you would prefer to work solo on, please DM the instructors ASAP.

1. Finally, there are NO dumb questions. Chances are, if you have a question, someone else does too, so be the brave person and speak up and ask it! It's extra easy to struggle in silence in a remote setting and that's the last thing we want to happen! Many of our sections will start with you experimenting with a new concept in pairs, and we expect that questions will come out of that. We'll also ask for guesses - as programmers, we all know that sometimes the errors are more helpful than the correct solution and it's ok to be wrong! We want this to work for you, so don't be shy!


*Below you'll find an overview of what we'll try to cover each day.  This is an outline is by no means set in stone.  We find these sessions work best when they're dynamic and interactive.  So we'll build out some examples together, break up into pairs, and get into the habit of committing and pushing what we work on up to Github.  By the end of the course we should have quite a bit of material built up for you to reference in future journey with Rails.*
